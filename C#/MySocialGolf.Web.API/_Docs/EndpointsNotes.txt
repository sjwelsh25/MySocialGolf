REST practitioners are split on how to solve the problem of associating resources. 
Some say that the hierarchy should continue to grow, giving endpoints like:
/customers/5/orders for all of customer #5's orders 
/customers/5/orders/3 for Customer #5's third order

Others argue to keep things flat by including associated details in the data for a resource. Under this paradigm, creating an order requires a customer_id
/orders   --> where customerId must be passed in
